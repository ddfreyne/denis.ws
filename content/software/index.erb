<p>I am a professional software developer. At my day job, I write Smalltalk (not kidding), and when I get home I can't quite seem to stop coding. I rock at Ruby, Smalltalk, C and Objective-C. For details, have a look at my <a href="http://stoneship.org/cv/" title="Denis Defreyneâ€™s CV">curriculum vitae</a>.</p>

<p>Most of my open-source projects are located in <a href="http://projects.stoneship.org/hg/">Stoneship's Mercurial repositories</a>. Some other personal projects are <a href="http://github.com/ddfreyne/">over at github</a>, but you can expect them to be converted to Mercurial sometime soon.</p>
