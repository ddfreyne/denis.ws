<p>adsf (A Dead Simple Fileserver) is a tiny web server that you can launch instantly in any directory, like this:</p>

<pre>▸ ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 ddfreyne  staff  68 May 29 10:04 about
drwxr-xr-x  2 ddfreyne  staff  68 May 29 10:04 contact
-rw-r--r--  1 ddfreyne  staff   0 May 29 10:04 index.html
drwxr-xr-x  2 ddfreyne  staff  68 May 29 10:04 projects

▸ adsf
[2009-05-29 10:04:44] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2009-05-29 10:04:44] INFO  ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11) [i686-darwin9.6.1]
[2009-05-29 10:04:44] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=2757 port=3000</pre>

<p>… and now you can go to <kbd>http://localhost:3000/</kbd> and start browsing.</p>

<p>adsf will serve the index.html of requested directories. adsf does not have support for directory listings, so requesting a directory without index.html will simply return a 404.</p>

<p>You can install adsf using RubyGems, like this (will also install the Rack dependency):</p>

<pre>> <kbd>sudo gem install adsf</kbd></pre>

<p>The code for adsf is available in the <a href="http://github.com/ddfreyne/adsf">adsf repository on GitHub</a>. Pull requests are welcome.</p>

<p>adsf is licenced under the liberal MIT licence.</p>
