<p>Cri is a Ruby library for building easy-to-use commandline applications with support for subcommands. Hereâ€™s what a command could look like:</p>

<pre>command = Cri::Command.define do
  name        'dostuff'
  usage       'dostuff [options]'
  aliases     :ds, :stuff
  summary     'does stuff'
  description 'This command does a lot of stuff. I really mean a lot.'

  flag   :h, :help,  'show help for this command' do |value, cmd|
    puts cmd.help
    exit 0
  end
  flag   :m, :more,  'do even more stuff'
  option :s, :stuff, 'specify stuff to do', :argument => :required

  run do |opts, args, cmd|
    stuff = opts[:stuff] || 'generic stuff'
    puts "Doing #{stuff}!"

    if opts[:more]
      puts 'Doing it even more!'
    end
  end
end</pre>
