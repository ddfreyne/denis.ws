<div class="note"><p><strong>Warning:</strong> The sound level at which the mix was recorded is too high, which unfortunately causes rather severe distortion starting with "Aus Birgittes Tagebuch." You may want to stop listening at about 26:30 unless you don't mind the distortion. I shall keep a closer eye on my "gain" knob next time!</p></div>
