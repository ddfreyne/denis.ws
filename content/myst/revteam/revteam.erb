	<h3>The Interview</h3>

	<ol class="hchatlog interview">
		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">MystoJVC</span></cite> (to Mary): <q>Which one between Exile and Revelation stories are you most proud? And why?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>I guess I&#8217;d have to say Revelation. Primarily because the story is so much more complex and so much deeper than Exile&#8217;s was. And because I worked with some really great game designers to get it right!</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">coolwind</span></cite> (to Patrick): <q>There has been a lot of confusion about the Collector&#8217;s Edition. What exactly does it include?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>A NICER box!!! (big one for me! :)). The making of movies (5 of them). Playing cards (special deck). And I think that is it?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Gwenaël</span></cite>: <q>Yes, the making of the intro cinematic.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Olivier</span></cite>: <q>Original soundtrack?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Yes, original soundtrack! How could I forget, that&#8217;s a HUGE one.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>I should chime in here. There is 100+ minutes of music in the soundtrack. So we put some of the music in the CE.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Kha&#8217;tie</span></cite>: <q>What was your favorite part of the creation process?  And what was your favorite part of Revelation?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Gwenaël</span></cite>: <q>It took a long time to realize, from scratch and it was very challenging. At the end, it&#8217;s not flawless but I love the look. :)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>I loved being able to work in Montreal. :-) Now, looking back on it, I guess my favorite part is realizing how many of the goals we set at the beginning of the project ended up being met in the final product. </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Olivier</span></cite>: <q>Growing plants on Haven. Took a long time ;-).</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Sebastien</span></cite>: <q>The puzzle design was grrrrreat!</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>I would say that what I love most was to work with the team and feel the trust when proposing new avenues&#8230;</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Favorite part of creation was building the game structure and defining our original &#8220;Myst Comes to Life&#8221; vision.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">MystoJVC</span></cite> (to Jack): <q>Which orchestra did you prefer to work with: the Seattle Philharmonic Orchestra (Exile) or the Slovak Radio Symphony?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>I loved traveling through Europe and Montreal to record the score. Both had their pluses. I think that the best part of Revelation and the slovak radio orch was that it was sort of like being in a Myst world to record the music. It felt really right for the game! Seattle was amazing because there were some truly magical moments with the orchestra there - some I&#8217;ll never ever forget. For example, I remember when we recorded the Exile Main theme - there was this feeling when we recorded the final take where the whole room just seemed to come alive and people there were really effected by it. In Bratislava, the Revelation score has a totally different feel to it, much more ethereal with the orchestra - lots of Adagios and more emotive music at slower tempos. Great experience there!</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">jsm</span></cite> (to Patrick): <q>There has been some argument about what exactly is in the standard edition box (# of DVD&#8217;s, etc.) Can we get an authoratative answer. Same goes for CE.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>As far a I know, 2 dvds and an instruction booklet in the standard box. And the stuff we talked about in the CE (making of, playing cards, soundtrack).</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Ron</span></cite>: <q>Limited Edition boxes have a third dvd, which is Exile.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Eat_My_Shortz</span></cite> (to Mary, David, Patrick): <q>Uru was developed alongside Revelation. Did you get any inspiration from Uru, particularly from the character Yeesha?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>I would have to say no to that. </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Inspiration for Yeesha came initially from conversations with RAWA and Cyan about how they saw Yeesha&#8217;s character. We didn&#8217;t actually speak about how URU was handling her, just how Cyan saw her character overall. </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>We were too much in the early stages of Revelation and Cyan was busy putting the final touches on URU, so neither team had any time to speak with the other. </q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>Exactly&#8230; we worked on our side and then, made sure that everything was ok with Cyan.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Macnbc</span></cite>: <q>So far in America I have seen very little marketing, advertising, or media coverage for Myst IV.  How much work has gone into marketing the game, and should we expect more prominent advertising for it now that it&#8217;s out?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Hopefully lots! &#8230; :) As to how it will turn out, time will tell.  But you SHOULD be seeing more stuff in the upcoming days and weeks.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">randomos</span></cite>: <q>There will be a lot of advertising that&#8217;s really exciting- a coworker saw two busses this morning with Myst Revelation banners. And, let me announce this here, there will also be movie trailers in Landmark cinemas this month! I haven&#8217;t seen the trailers yet- totally excited. We&#8217;ll post more news on that today on <a href="http://www.mystworlds.com/">mystworlds.com</a>.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">The World</span></cite> (to Jack): <q>from what angle did you approach writing the score for Myst 4, as opposed to writing for Myst 3?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>Well without spoiliing anything&#8230; :) With Exile the score was centered around Saavedro. For Revelation, I felt that the emotion center again was at the heart of the story that Mary, Patrick and the rest of the team were working on of course. It all centers around one of the Ages and the people there. Then of course each Age has it&#8217;s own unique and original sound. I kept some of the flavor from Robyn&#8217;s Myst and Riven scores to keep it all together. One of the pieces is a 6 1/2 minute version of Atrus&#8217; theme done with a 76 piece orchestra - it&#8217;s actually very subtle not bombastic. </q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Dan&#8217;ni</span></cite> (to Olivier, David, Gwenaël, Sebastien): <q>What were your inspirations (and how did you manage to come up with such cool stuff) for the different Ages we&#8217;re going to visit in the game?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>Everything was good for inpiration, but shamanistic played a very important part for one part&#8230; mechanical stuff of course&#8230; a tree behind the office was my inspiration for one of the puzzles.. and of course, the technology we were developping specifically for the game. What is fantastic about this project is that we did research for almost a year to find inspiration for the puzzles (and the rest of course)&#8230; </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Sebastien</span></cite>: <q>For Spire, it was electricity and sound sciences&#8230;  and loneliness.  For Haven, it was our whole world !! :) Also, ideas and inspiration comming from the whole team helped a lot ! We had a complete encyclopedia and many small brainteasers on the floor ! </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Olivier</span></cite>: <q>I worked with sebastien on Haven and everything was set about this age (or almost) when i arrived on this project and i just had to make all the places in Haven look realistic.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Gwenaël</span></cite>: <q>Brussels architecture was a big influence during the tomahna setup. Parts of &#8216;art nouveau&#8217; were almost ripped of, I must admit. :) Metropolitain structs, facade details, paintings, furnitures, gaz lamps, etc. </q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Foo</span></cite>: <q>Did you manage to sneak any easter eggs into the game (such as a strange pair of batman boxers or something)</q></li>
		<li class="message question middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Dan&#8217;ni</span></cite>: <q>or Triforce? ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Hey&#8230;:)   No boxers, but yeah&#8230;maybe a few tiny little easter eggs&#8230; Not as much as we would have like unfortunately&#8230;:(</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Chucker</span></cite>: <q>Any bananaphones included?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Hey hey&#8230; :)  I don&#8217;t think there were any bananaphones, but bananaphones did help us REACH the end, so they are part of the game in some way I guess&#8230; :)</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Jerle</span></cite> (to Jack): <q>When you write your music, do you have the visuals in front of you or do you read the story line first or both?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>Yes, for Revelation, we had alot of visuals pretty close to the beginniing of my tiime on the project. that defintiely helped alot. And then there was loads of time iin Montreal, on the phone with Patrick and Mary and then&#8230; tadaaa!!! Mary came and paid me a visit during E3 to make sure I wasn&#8217;t screwing up her story line!! :) </q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Jerle</span></cite> (to Mary): <q>I understand that you write fanfic. Do you have a favorite kind that you still write? Do you read any Myst fanfic?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>I don&#8217;t really write fanfic anymore.  (Although, technically, writing Exile and Revelation WAS writing fanfic. As a teenager, I used to write Nancy Drew fanfic. And also Anne McCaffery&#8217;s Pern stories.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Lakem</span></cite>: <q>What languages were used in the game and music?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>I used two languages - Sanskrit for music in Spire and Serani - very much like Narani for Serenia. I&#8217;m going to start to archive all the lyric from Exile and Revelation along with translations over the next couple of weeks - on the Myst IV Journal area of my site.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>English for the scripting, which was then translated into how many languages?</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">AdricTW</span></cite>: <q>After Mr. Miller stated that he would never appear in a MYST game again, what did you have to do that made him change his mind?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Beg :-).</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Sebastien</span></cite>: <q>He loves Montreal!!! ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>We kidnapped Yeesha ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Once he saw what we were trying to do with Revelation, things went very well.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Promise that we wouldn&#8217;t make his role bigger than Exile&#8217;s, then creatively bend the interpretation of &#8220;more.&#8221; We also promised a teleprompter on set.</q></li>
		<li class="message question middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Kha&#8217;tie</span></cite>: <q>Mary - did Rand actually end up USING the Teleprompter??</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Not really, he practised at home for 2 weeks and had memorized all the lines. He just wanted it as a security blanket.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Not really.  He knew all his lines by heart.  And he even suggested on the set changes to some of the dialog.  But the teleprompter&#8217;s presence made him feel more comfortable./</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Kha&#8217;tie</span></cite>: <q>That&#8217;s very cool!</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Alahmnat</span></cite>: <q>will we be able to export our pictures and journal entries from the game?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Argh! :(   No, not really&#8230; Actually, no. Sorry, ran out of time for that&#8230; :( I know&#8230; I know&#8230; :(</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>Do I hear&#8230; patch? ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Gwenaël</span></cite>: <q>Yes, an html export would be nice&#8230;</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Well&#8230;  Patch = Yes,  but not for this particular feature&#8230;</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Gwenaël</span></cite>: <q>Lol, Patrick, do not look at me like that. ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Hey hey&#8230; :)</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">martin</span></cite>: <q>Do you think for solving the puzzles or understand the worlds, does the game adress more to logical, technical thinking people or to creative, full-of-fantasy kind of people? or does it depend on the age? (and how simple is it really with all the help-systems etc&#8230;?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>I think it depends on the age, actually.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Sebastien</span></cite>: <q>Both players will be happy to find their own favorite puzzles !  They are all different. </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>The puzzles of Tomahna and Serenia are mostly deduction oriented.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>We tried to cater to all the different kinds of logic, so yes, I would say it depends on the Age and the puzzle. Not unlike the original Myst in fact&#8230; It was important to us to have variety in the thematics of the puzzle, that was an objective from the very start</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>The solutions are related to the environments</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Lenin</span></cite>: <q>What will be the subtitles languages? Or there will be only english? Thx.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Once the patch comes out, ALL the languages should support subtitles&#8230; I hope&#8230;?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Pat, do you know what languages the game supports? </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>I think 7? Dave?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>English, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese (if I remember well). But japanese will be a separate version. </q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">Sh`aeri</span></cite>: <q>When they went and made the textures for the game, did they check the sounds it made, i.e. knocking on a particular wood or metal for a sound so that way they had a touchy feely kind of thing going?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Yeah, the sound think was decided early on and I was terrified it would be cut because it was so much work for the sound guys to not only gather this bank of sounds but to actually take the time to &#8220;paint&#8221; the hotspots (hotspots = location of the screen players can click on to activate somthing) atop all the objects in the game. But I am SOOO happy with the result, it really does what I imagined it would in my head and that is, it gives textures and physicality to the whole game.  It&#8217;s also a fun thing to play around with while your thinking about the solution of a puzzle.  It gives you something to do all the time and makes the exploration of the environments that much more immersive!</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">AdricTW</span></cite> (to Jack): <q>What was the most dificult piece to compose, and why?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>The main theme was particularly difficult though because it&#8217;s where I had to wrap it all up and find the core of the story. I hope that I did that for the players. It&#8217;s really about playing the game all the way through for me iin the finished state to see how it all worked together.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">MystoJVC</span></cite> (to Mary): <q>Is the revelation in Myst IV as intense and shocking as the ones in Philip K. Dick stories?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t read a lot of Phillip K. Dick. Just Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#8230; </q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>Don&#8217;t woory&#8230; it&#8217;s all end up the same  ;)</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Myst</span></cite>: <q>As for the revelation in Myst Iv&#8230; I hope we&#8217;ve managed to surprise you.  In more ways than one.</q></li>

		<li class="message question"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="nickname">jamesjames</span></cite>: <q>Were you given free rein (within reason) or were there certain rules that had to be abided by: re story, places we would see, the mythology?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>The story had to revolve around the brothers&#8230;</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>We were given a lot of leeway to create within specific guidelines.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>We had &#8220;carte blanche&#8221;, but we didn&#8217;t want to do things which would not be true to the essense of Myst (ie, guns, or Atrus smoking cigarettes on his front porch, etc, etc). So it was important to us to know that Cyan approved of what we did.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Jack</span></cite>: <q>For music, I had loads of freedom,  but I made sure to keep Robyn&#8217;s original ideas alive and used them here and there to glue things together. Other than that, our feeling was that these are original worlds, so let&#8217;s get original with it.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>As for me, though, I think I put more constraints on the story and characters than I was originally told to, because I feel so strongly that the story remain within specifics of the license. That is, that it stay true to what has been stated. While adding even more. And tying in old threads&#8230; And now I ramble&#8230;</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Patrick</span></cite>: <q>Storywise, I think the only no-nos where: don&#8217;t talk about a certain Age (you know which one) and don&#8217;t delve on the &#8220;technology&#8221; behind the Art. And don&#8217;t make Atrus more present then in the other episodes :) Although I think we managed to bend that one, no?</q></li>
		<li class="message answer middle"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">Mary</span></cite>: <q>Which we ignored. (The Atrus thing) just a bit.</q></li>
		<li class="message answer"><cite class="sender vcard"><span class="fn">David</span></cite>: <q>yes :)</q></li>
