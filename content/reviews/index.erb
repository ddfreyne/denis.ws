<p>Here’s the list of stuff that I’ve reviewed. I intend to keep this up to date when possible; whenever I find something that’s worth (or perhaps not worth at all) watching, playing or using, I’ll put it in this list. I won’t be reviewing music, because <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/amonre">my Last.fm profile</a> should already be enough to give you an idea of what I think is good.</p>

<% @item.children.map { |c| c[:subtype] }.uniq.sort.each do |subtype| %>

<h2><%= subtype.capitalize %>s</h2>

<ul>
<% @item.children.select { |c| c[:subtype] == subtype }.sort_by { |i| i[:title] }.each do |review| %>
	<li><%= rating_code_for(review) %> <%= review.path ? link_to(review[:title], review) : h(review[:title]) %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>

<% end %>
