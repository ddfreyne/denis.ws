<p><i>David Lynch</i>'s <i>Blue Velvet</i> has been slowly climbing up to be one of my all-time favourite movies. Its simple story and stunning imagery will keep on the edge of your seat.</p>

<p><i>Jeffrey Beaumont</i> (<i>Kyle MacLachlan</i>) is a young man living in an idyllic little town. One day, after discovering a severed human ear in a field, Jeffrey invokes the police, but they remain idle. He decides to investigate the case on his own, with the help of detective William's daughter <i>Sandy</i> (<i>Laura Dern</i>), only to be thrown into a dark underworld beneath their small village.</p>

<p><i>Blue Velvet</i>'s story is, in essence, quite straightforward. There are no supernatural demons, no dream worlds, and time linearly flows forward. The real beauty of this film is the strong imagery: colorful roses against an immaculate white fence, darkly lit corridors, unsettlingly tidy apartment rooms.</p>

<p>The actors' performances are all simply great. For example, <i>MacLachlan</i>'s character is convincingly innocent—or maybe exactly the opposite. However, every single character is blown out of the water by <i>Dennis Hopper</i>, who plays a disturbingly psychotic and evil character—probably <i>Hopper</i>'s all-time best role.</p>

<p><i>Blue Velvet</i> contains quite a bit of music. Most noticeable is <i>Bobby Vinton</i>'s song after which the film is named, but there is also <i>Roy Orbison</i>'s <i>In Dreams</i>, used in a scene that won't get out of your head once you've seen it.</p>

<p>It is striking that some scenes have no music at all, leaving them open to interpretation. In scenes with music, the score, composed by <i>Angelo Badalamenti</i>, greatly contributes to the film's atmosphere. In other words, music is used carefully but effectively.</p>

<p><i>Blue Velvet</i> is probably Lynch's masterpiece. This film will slowly drag you down, and won't release its grip until long after you've finished watching this movie. A must-see for everyone who likes psychological thrillers.</p>
