excerpt:      "<i>Portal: Prelude</i> is an unofficial, fan-made prequel to <i>Valve</i>'s popular <i>Portal</i> game. The mod is quite disappointing, however. Weak dialogue, below-average voice acting, and <em>hellishly</em> frustrating levels make this game barely worth playing."
oneliner:     "Defines the term 'sadistic gameplay'."
