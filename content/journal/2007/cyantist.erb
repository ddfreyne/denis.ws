A couple of weeks ago, [Ryan Warzecha](http://thegreydragon.com/) asked me whether I was interested in doing some web-related work for 
[Cyan Worlds](http://www.cyan.com/) (the company that made Myst). I said yes, and now I'm doing an internship, along with [Keith Lord](http://grey-skies.net/).

I am working remotely--I didn't actually move to the US--which creates a slightly odd working situation. Timezones can definitely be annoying at times. Imagine hearing "good morning" when you've just had dinner. I think this is something I'll get used to soon enough.

Even though this is just an internship, and not an employment, this is a great opportunity to get experience working for a company I've always admired, instead of pursuing my own projects (of which most are doomed anyway).

Just in case you were wondering: the rumours saying that I am Keith Lord's assistant are false and not true.
