<p>nanoc has recently gained an entirely new way of specifying how pages should be processed. Instead of describing processing instructions in YAML, they are now described using pure Ruby, like this:</p>

<pre><code>compile '/articles/*/' do
  filter :erb
  filter :markdown

  layout 'article'

  filter :rubypants
end</code></pre>

<p>These rules are located in a file called <em>Rules</em>, which is loaded by nanoc on startup. This blog article explains how these rules are implemented so that you can use the same idea in your projects.</p>

<p>There are two slightly different ways of implementing such a DSL, and I'll describe them both in this post. The first iteration of nanoc used a DSL based on method #1, but in the second iteration I switched to the cleaner, prettier method #2.</p>

<p>For demonstration purposes, this blog post will not use nanoc's domain-specific language, but instead use a much more minimal language that uses a <code>#process</code> method to define rules. The Rules file in the example will look like this:

<pre><code>process /oo/ do
  puts "I am rule /oo/ and I am processing #{item.inspect}!"
end</code></pre>

<h2>Method #1</h2>

<p>This method uses a DSL that looks slightly different: it has an explicit <code>item</code> parameter, and all methods are called explicitly on this item. A Rules file written using method #1 looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>process /oo/ do |item|
  puts "I am rule /oo/ and I am processing #{item.inspect}!"
end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#process</code> function creates a <em>rule</em> (I'll show you how in a bit) which can be applied to an item. The first function argument is a pattern that specifies which items this rule can be applied to. When nanoc loads the Rules file, it creates a <code>Rule</code> instance containing this pattern as well as a block containing the actual code. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Rule

  def initialize(pattern, block)
    @pattern = pattern
    @block   = block
  end

  def applicable_to?(item)
    item.identifier =~ @pattern
  end

  def apply_to(item)
    @block.call(item)
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#applicable_to?</code> method is used for determining whether the rule is able to process a given item, and the <code>#apply_to</code> method performs the actual processing by calling the block and giving the item as a parameter.</p>

<p>The Item class is, in this case, rather simple: it only contains an <code>identifier</code> attribute. It is implemented like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Item

  attr_reader :identifier

  def initialize(identifier)
    @identifier = identifier
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>Here's how the rules file is loaded and parsed:</p>

<pre><code>class App

  def initialize
    @rules = []
  end

  def load_rules
    rules_content = File.read('Rules')
    dsl = DSL.new(@rules)
    dsl.instance_eval(rules_content)
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>#instance_eval</code> method takes a block or a string and evaluates it in the content of the object on which the method is called. The last line of the code example above evaluates the string, which contains the content of the rules file, in the context of a <code>DSL</code> instance.</p>

<p>The idea is to have the <code>#process</code> method implemented in this <code>DSL</code> instance. This method then generates a <code>Rule</code> instance using the pattern and the block given to the <code>#process</code> call, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class DSL

  def initialize(rules)
    @rules = rules
  end

  def process(pattern, &amp;block)
    @rules &lt;&lt; Rule.new(pattern, block)
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>rules</code> array contains all rules. To actually use these rules, i.e. find a rule for an item and apply it, you'd use something like this (no error checking implemented):</p>

<pre><code>class App

  def process(item)
    rule = rules.find { |r| r.applicable_to?(item) }
    rule.apply_to(item)
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>And that's how the DSL is implemented using method #1.</p>

<h2>Method #2</h2>

<p>The second method gets rid of the extra block parameter to the <code>#process</code> call. Using method #2, the Rules file looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>process /oo/ do
  puts "I am rule /oo/ and I am processing #{item.inspect}!"
end</code></pre>

<p>To get rid of the extra <code>item</code> parameter, the block will have to be evaluated in the context of an object that provides access to the item in a different way. One way of doing this is to provide an <code>@item</code> variable in a <code>RuleContext</code> object, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class RuleContext

  def initialize(item)
    @item = item
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>Applying a rule to an item no longer involves calling the block and giving the item as a parameter. Instead, a <code>RuleContext</code> is created with a given item, and then the block is evaluated in the context of this rule context, like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Rule

  def apply_to(item)
    rule_context = RuleContext.new(item)
    rule_context.instance_eval(&amp;@block)
  end

end</code></pre>

<p>Accessing the item is now done using <code>@item</code>. If you want to be able to use <code>item</code> without that <code>@</code> sigil, define an accessor:</p>

<pre><code>class RuleContext

  attr_reader :item

end</code></pre>

<p>And that's how method #2 works.</p>

<p>You can get the source of the example implementation <a href="http://stoneship.org/pub/software/how-nanocs-rules-dsl-works.tar.bz2">over here</a>. It contains two directories; one for each method. Each directory contains a dsl.rb file which contains the library code, a test.rb file which can be executed, and of course a Rules file which contains the rules.</p>
