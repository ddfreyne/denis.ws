Here are a few interesting comments on [Jeffrey Zeldman's XHTML WTF article](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/):

> I don’t understand why this is happening. Didn’t XHTML fix all the inconsistencies in HTML? HTML5 seems to bring back a lot of those inconsistencies from what I’ve seen so far. WTF indeed.

Because XHTML 1.0 is so much more consistent than HTML 4.01! [#](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comment-43868)

> So what happens now? Leave tags open? Validate code to what standard? Sigh, Googling HTML 5 resources..

Because HTML 5 is not, and never will be, a standard! [#](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comment-43875)

> There’s a long time to debate this, IE6 doesn’t support HTML5. IE8/FF/Safari have partial support. So we’re back to that again. We can’t actually use HTML 5 yet because we want to provide a good experience accross the range of browsers our visitors have. XHTML will remain the best way to do this for many years to come.

Because Internet Explorer totally supports XHTML! [#](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comment-43953)

> I just scratched the surface with my xhtml reading and im in love with it. HTML 5… not so much. Haven’t we been working to move away from pages filled with crap defining colors and towards pages containing useful info and tags to define who is what? This is moving backwards. Its a bad move.

Because in HTML 5 you *have* to use `<FONT>` for colors and `<TABLE>` for layout! [#](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comment-43896)

> Also, for the sake of chronicle, whenever I tried to parse XHTML as XML through ruby I failed miserably, falling back to hpricot, which treats everything as HTML, and works very well, so maybe some looseness isn’t that bad.

Because parsing XHTML as HTML is the way to go! [#](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comment-43952)

And so on, and so on, and so on. Browse through [the comments](http://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/#comments) and see for yourself. I seriously had no idea that the number of ignorant web developers is so huge. People need to be educated, *fast*.
