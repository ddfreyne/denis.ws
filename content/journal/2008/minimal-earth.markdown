I got tired of the old site design and built a new one from scratch.

I didn't like using borders for separating elements from each other. I didn't like giving separate elements different backgrounds either, so I'm simply relying on whitespace now.

I picked a brownish color scheme because brown is super cool these days. I'm calling this design _Minimal Earth_ for a reason. I'll completely ignore you if you tell me my site looks like shit, so don't even try.

I also got rid of the comments. I never really cared much for the concept of letting strangers put _their_ content on _your_ site. I prefer to be the only one in control of my web site, sorry. I also couldn't get my sweet ajaxy comments implementation to function correctly on Internet Explorer, and I really didn't feel like debugging my scripts.

I also like starting my sentences with "I". I really do.
