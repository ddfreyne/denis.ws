excerpt:      "France, some time after the second world war. The country is in ruins, and there is not enough food around for everyone. The landlord of an apartment in a rural part of the country solves this by continuing his job as a butcher, regularly hiring new employees, eventually slaughtering them and serving them to his customers."
oneliner:     "Great post-apocalyptic story."
