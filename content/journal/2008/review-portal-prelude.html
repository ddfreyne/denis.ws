		<p><a href="http://www.portalprelude.com/">Portal: Prelude</a> is an unofficial fan-made prequel to <i>Valve</i>'s awesome <a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html">Portal</a> game. Like many others, I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this mod. Yesterday, I got the opportunity to download and play it.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, excitement was quickly replaced by disappointment immediately after the start of the game. For starters, the game's dialogues are riddled with grammar errors. <q>That was close, doesn't it?</q> is just one of many mistakes. Recruiting a native English speaker would not have been just a luxury. The dialogues are extremely awkward, which pretty much ruins any attempt at an in-dialogue joke.</p>

		<p>The test chambers in the original <i>Portal</i> were fun and entertaining. <i>Portal: Prelude</i>'s puzzles, on the other hand, are <em>hellishly frustrating</em>. For many puzzles you need <em>exact</em> timing, you need to be able to aim at <em>exactly</em> the right spot, and on top of all that, you need a <em>huge</em> load of luck and a <em>lot</em> of patience.</p>

		<p>Figuring out <em>how</em> to find the exit of a given test chamber is not too hard. Actually <em>getting there</em> is a whole other story. In short, <i>Portal: Prelude</i>'s gameplay is purely sadistic.</p>

		<p>The game relies on crouching while jumping. According to the developers, crouching affects momentum. Huh? Momentum is the product of mass and velocity; crouching changes neither factor. Drag? Hardly relevant. Get your physics right, please.</p>

		<p>Nicolas, <i>Portal: Prelude</i>'s lead developer, regularly mentions that the game has been play-tested. Considering I couldn't finish the first part of the second test chamber for more than half an hour, even after getting numerous hints from the forums, I can hardly believe there really was any play-testing at all.</p>

		<p>I was expecting a mod with maps that resembled the original <i>Portal</i>'s advanced levels: difficult, challenging, but well-balanced. Instead, I got a bunch of maps that rely on quirks in the game's physics.</p>

		<p>I'm tempted to say <q>I'm making a note here, great failure</q> but that would probably be too harsh. <i>Portal: Prelude</i> is not a bad attempt, but it nonetheless falls short in many aspects. It's probably a better idea to (re)play the original <i>Portal</i>'s advanced or challenge levels instead of this mod.</p>
