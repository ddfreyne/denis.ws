<div class="note"><p><strong>Update:</strong> Stoneship has been redesigned and comments are gone. There are quite a few reasons for that, but it's mostly because I dislike the idea of letting <em>other</em> people put content on <em>your</em> site. Read the <a href="/journal/2008/minimal-earth/">redesign journal entry</a> for details.</p></div>

<p>As of today, <del>Stoneship has support for blog comments.</del></p>

At the bottom of the page, you will see a very pretty form, which, when filled in and submitted, will cause a comment to appear on this page. Nothing revolutionary, just pretty and useful (hopefully).

The anti-spam system is inspired by Peter Hosey's [Negative Turing Test](http://boredzo.org/blog/archives/category/creations/negative-turing-test) plugin for WordPress. To pass the anti-spam test, you need to know the name of this site, and you need to have common sense, along with mad text field editing skillz.

Only this article as well as two others, [On Requiring Parens in Ruby](/journal/2008/on-requiring-parens-in-ruby/) and [Myst Online and Me](/journal/2008/myst-online-and-me/), have comments enabled. It's not possible to comment on older articles, but I don't think there's a point in commenting on an article I wrote last year.

The code for the commenting system is available in the [Subversion repository for this site](http://stoneship.org/svn/nanoc/samples/stoneship/). Once the code is thoroughly tested, I may package this comments system and release it. I think [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) users will like this.

So, who shall be the first one to yell "FIRST POST"?
