This page collects the tools that I use on a daily basis. I’ve left out common tools (Git, macOS, Docker, …) in order to focus on perhaps lesser-known things.

## Desktop apps

### For macOS

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (productivity app)
: Alfred gives me the power to do all the things I want, right when I need them, without introducing clutter. I have a handful of custom workflows tuned for the way I work, which I imagine impresses my coworkers.

[Anvil](https://anvilformac.com/) (local web server for static sites)
: I use Anvil in combination with [Nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/) to preview local static sites that I’m working on.

[OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) (diagramming and drawing app)
: It isn’t cheap, but I find the $100 price tag to be worth it. I use it to impress my coworkers.

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) (window management app)
: This is how I keep my windows nicely tiled.

[Vox](https://vox.rocks/mac-music-player) (music player)
: A music player with a clean interface that isn’t resource-hungry.

### Cross-platform

[SoundCleod](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod) (SoundCloud desktop app)
: A dedicated app for SoundCloud with support for media keys (▶❚❚ etc).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (code editor)
: I switched from [Atom](https://atom.io/), which by itself is already an amazing piece of software, to Visual Studio Code, which is at the same level of awesomenes.

## Fonts

[Input](http://input.fontbureau.com/)
: It’s pretty.

[Iosevka](https://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka/)
: It’s pretty, and has ligatures.

## CLI tools

[fish](https://fishshell.com/)
: A fast, easy-to-use shell that has sensible defaults. I have barely customised it.

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
: A fast search tool, similar to grep, ack. and ag.

[xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv)
: A must-have tool if you deal with CSV files.

## Ruby gems

[hamster](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster)
: Provides efficient immutable data structures (sometimes more efficient than built-in Ruby ones).

[m](https://github.com/qrush/m) (selective Test::Unit runner)
: Useful when you want to only run specific Test::Unit test cases.

[ref](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/ref)
: Provides a soft ref implementation, which is indispensable for effective memoization.

[rspec](http://rspec.info/)
: I feel lost without it.

[rubocop](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/)
: Indispensable when writing Ruby code. It pretty much eliminates all discussions about style.
