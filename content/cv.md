I have been coding for at least half of my life, and I’m only getting started.

I put my heart and soul into the projects I work on. I don’t just cross the finish line, but I go further and deliver a truly satisfying experience to clients. I am dedicated: I don’t do half work. I take the responsibilities necessary for getting a project done, even if that means stepping outside the boundaries of being a programmer.

I love working with people. I enjoy committing myself with a team of talented co-workers, getting done what needs to be done, delivering high-quality software without cutting corners, and having fun while doing it.

Weapons of Choice
-----------------

Ruby, C, git, vim

Not looking for job opportunities involving Smalltalk or PHP.

Experience
----------

### Software Engineer, MediaGeniX NG

Period: September 2010 - now

Developed many features of MediaGenix’ _WHATS’On_ broadcasting solution for VIMN subsidiaries such as MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon for divisions in both Europe and Southeast Asia. During this period, I also performed two major upgrades for these clients. I implemented the necessary developments for the introduction of WHATS’On to MTV Adria.

### Intern, Netlog

Period: August 2009 - September 2009

Optimised an existing social network abuse detection system. I also proved that the abuse detection system was fundamentally flawed and would not work in real-world situations. Gathered ideas and did research on how to improve it and make it work, but time constraints prevented me from continuing.

### Web Application Developer (student job), dotProjects

Period: July 2008 - August 2008

Developed from scratch a web-based machine translation system aimed at making the translation of large documents easy, both manually and with the help of machine translation. This system is currently being used by customers such as ITV.

### Web Application Developer (student job), dotProjects

Period: July 2007 - August 2007

Aiding the development of a Ruby on Rails-driven backend of sites such as Cutting Edge and Auto55.be.

Education
---------

### Master in Computer Science, option Software Engineering, University of Ghent

Period: 2008 - 2010

I wrote a dissertation titled [Design of a recommendation system for offering services on social network sites](http://stoneship.org/pub/thesis.pdf) in co-operation with Netlog, a large social networking site with headquarters in Ghent, Belgium.

### Bachelor in Informatics, University of Ghent

Period: 2005 - 2009

Followed perhaps two of the coolest courses at university: compilers and programming languages. To this day I am quite interested in compilers, virtual machines, LLVM, programming languages, etc.

Personal Projects
-----------------

### nanoc

Period: 2007 - now

Since its inception early 2007, I have been the lead developer, and therefore also the one responsible for moving the project forward, giving support and handling community contributions.

nanoc has been downloaded tens of thousands of times and is being used by many web sites, including notable ones such as the Sproutcore web site, the GitHub developer resources, the FOSDEM web site and Disney’s Ugly Betty web site.

### Myst Online: Uru Live web site

Period: 2009

I revamped the existing web site by removing uses of Flash, redoing the site in proper HTML, CSS and JavaScript, cleaning up the design, and making the site a lot easier to maintain.

I also made the site multilingual and co-ordinated a handful of translation teams that helped translate the site into Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Finnish and German.

The site was re-coded from scratch using nanoc. This was one of the first big nanoc projects and it proved that nanoc was quite capable of handling large and complex web sites.
