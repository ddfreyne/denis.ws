I am a software engineer who has been developing applications for at least half of my life, and I’m only getting started.

I put my heart and soul into the projects I work on. I don’t just cross the finish line, but I go further and deliver a truly satisfying experience to clients. I am dedicated: I don’t do half work. I take the responsibilities necessary for getting a project done, even if that means stepping outside the boundaries of being a software developer.

I enjoy committing myself with a team of talented co-workers, getting done what needs to be done, delivering high-quality software without cutting corners, and having fun while doing it.

### Web Application Developer (student job), dotProjects

Personal Projects
-----------------

### nanoc

Period: 2007 - now

Since [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/)’s inception early 2007, I have been the lead developer, and therefore also the one responsible for moving the project forward, giving support and handling community contributions.

nanoc has been downloaded tens of thousands of times and is being used by many web sites, including notable ones such as the [FOSDEM web site](http://fosdem.org), the [GitHub API documentation](http://developer.github.com/) and Disney’s [Ugly Betty](http://www.dadt.com/uglybetty/) web site.

Skills: Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, git, Mercurial

### Myst Online: Uru Live web site

Period: 2009

I revamped the existing [Myst Online web site](http://mystonline.com/) by removing uses of Flash, redoing the site in proper HTML, CSS and JavaScript, cleaning up the design, and making the site a lot easier to maintain.

I also made the site multilingual and co-ordinated a handful of translation teams that helped translate the site into Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, Finnish and German.

The site was re-coded from scratch using nanoc. This was one of the first big nanoc projects and it proved that nanoc was quite capable of handling large and complex web sites.

Skills: Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
