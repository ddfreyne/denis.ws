# Get people on board with breaking changes by radiating intent
Elizabeth Ayer’s [Don’t ask forgiveness, radiate intent](https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/dont-ask-forgiveness-radiate-intent-d36fd22393a3) poses radiating intent as a good alternative to requesting permission or asking for forgiveness:

> For me, the idea came from L. David Marquet who suggests using “I intend to…” to your superiors. The idea is that if the subordinate reliably signals intent, it removes the supervisor’s inclination to micromanage, while still allowing them to intervene if really necessary.

I have used this approach at work (BCG Digital Ventures), where my product manager and me created a list of upcoming breaking changes, along with a deadline 14 days in the future, indicating the date on which those changes would be implemented. In the two weeks before that, people had the opportunity to raise concerns.

Even though we had trouble getting permission for these changes earlier, when we switched to radiating intent, only one upcoming breaking change received any objection at all.

Since we switched to radiating intent rather than asking for permission, we got more done, and the amount of back-and-forth communication dropped significantly.
