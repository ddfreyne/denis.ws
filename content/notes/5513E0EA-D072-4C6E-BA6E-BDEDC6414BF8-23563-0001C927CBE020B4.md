# Good notes don’t have a time aspect
::**To do**: Write one-paragraph summary.::

The invention of the blog (née weblog) came with a new standard way to broadcasting written information: clearly date-stamped posts, sorted in reverse chronological order.

Putting the date front-and-central on each blog post is problematic, because it reduces the up-to-dateness of a post to a single date with no context. For example, for a blog post from 2018, it’s easy to make a “old and probably irrelevant” snap judgement.

The nature of blogs makes this date stamp important, however. The blog format is a write-once, update-never format[^1]. The content in a blog post is not meant to be revised. If the content does require revision, a common approach is to mark the blog post as outdated, and write a new blog post, with a newer date stamp. Most often, though, old blog posts simply are not updated (they’re not meant to be) and become stale. The date stamp is thus necessary to identify potentially outdated content.

[^1]: Update-never, with the exceptional small spelling or grammar revision, or the addition of a “this post is outdated” notice near the top.

Knowledge accumulates and evolves over time. It makes sense for written content to be continuously updated as new information and insight arrives. Because of this, the blog format is not ideal for sharing knowledge.

::**To elaborate**: Some content really does need have a time aspect (e.g. a true daily log/journal). Such content can still live in a blog, with proper date stamps. For other content, consider a title that provides enough information (e.g. “how to upgrade to React 13” is clearly not relevant for most of us anymore).::

It still makes sense to keep track of the creation and modification dates in the content management system (I mean this in the large sense: a filesystem is also a content management system). Publishing the creation date, however, does not (especially not front and center).

## Choosing notes over blog posts
::**To elaborate**: Not having clearly date-stamped articles on my own notes has an additional benefit that’s psychological. I don’t feel the pressure to regularly add new content to my web site. I no longer feel apprehension about my site potentially appearing outdated and no longer relevant.::

## Comparing blog posts to books
::**To do**: Make it explicit that this is about non-fiction books.::

Book don’t mention the date when they were written on their cover, nor on the back side, nor on the spine. The information about when a book was written is usually in small print on the edition notice (copyright page).

Revising a book is time-consuming and expensive. Books are therefore inherently more write-only than online content. ::**Open question**: What does this mean? Do blog posts just date quicker? If so, why? Is it because blog posts are written with the intention of becoming obsolete anyway? Are we fetishizing freshness? Perhaps books don’t need their date stamp as clearly, because books are meant to be a long-lasting medium, and considerably more thought and research has gone into a book than in a blog post.::
