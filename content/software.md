title: Denis’ software

I write software! Here’s an incomplete list of the stuff I made and am working on. All of it is freely available as open source under the MIT license.

## Production-ready

The following pieces of software have been around for a significant amount of time and are used in production environments. You can rely on them.

[adsf](https://github.com/ddfreyne/adsf) is a web server that you can launch instantly in any directory.

[cri](https://github.com/ddfreyne/cri) helps build command-line applications in Ruby.

[ddmemoize](https://github.com/ddfreyne/ddmemoize) implements memoization for Ruby.

[ddmetrics](https://github.com/ddfreyne/ddmetrics) records and analyses runtime measurements for Ruby apps.

[ddplugin](https://github.com/ddfreyne/ddplugin) is a Ruby library for handling plugins.

[nanoc](https://nanoc.ws) is a fast and flexible static-site generator.

[slow_enumerator_tools](https://github.com/ddfreyne/slow_enumerator_tools) supports merging, buffering, … Ruby enumerators.

## Experimental

The following pieces of software are work in progress. Their APIs are unstable, they are buggy, but… they are probably more exciting than the production-ready ones. Play around with them, but don’t use them for real work.

[d★mark](https://github.com/ddfreyne/d-mark) is a semantically-rich markup language for prose

[d★parse](https://github.com/ddfreyne/d-parse) is a parser combinator library for Ruby

[d★stream](https://github.com/ddfreyne/d-stream) allows writing stream-processing code in Ruby

[glove](https://github.com/ddfreyne/glove) is a game engine for Crystal
