<p>I am a professional software developer. At my day job, I write Smalltalk (not kidding), and when I get home I can't quite seem to stop coding. I rock at Ruby, Smalltalk, C and Objective-C. For details, have a look at my <a href="http://stoneship.org/cv/" title="Denis Defreyneâ€™s CV">curriculum vitae</a>. I naturally also have a <a href="http://github.com/ddfreyne">GitHub profile</a> where my code belongs (though some of my projects still remain in <a href="http://projects.stoneship.org/hg/">my Mercurial repositories</a>).</p>
