Stoneship site
==============

This is the source for the Stoneship site (<http://stoneship.org/>), which
is my personal web site. This site is provided as an example to show off
how nanoc can be used, and that there is no need to keep your site source
secret; none of it runs on the server anyway.

Also check out the nanoc site source, available in the Subversion repository
at <http://stoneship.org/svn/nanoc/samples/nanoc-site/>.

Requirements
------------

You will need nanoc 1.6 or higher, as well as:

* json
* builder
* BlueCloth
* rubypants
